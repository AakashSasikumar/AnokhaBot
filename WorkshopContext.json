                "The Aspen Hysys Workshop is conducted by the CHEMICAL Department. Here's a gist of what it's going to be like. Over the past decade, the Chemical Engineering industry has turned away from the traditional way of experimentation-based results to simulation-based results in order to scale up and reduce cost and time. ASPEN HYSYS software workshop aims at equipping students with simulation-based tools for chemical processes. This software will prepare students for corporate jobs which require a certain level of expertise in modeling and simulation. Students currently pursuing 3rd and 4th year of Undergraduate and Postgraduate studies in Chemical Engineering, Petroleum Refining, Petrochemical Engineering and allied areas are encouraged to register. During this 3-day workshop, the course attendees will be trained on the commercially available software, ASPEN HYSYS. Students will learn about simulation of individual equipment such as pumps, compressors, flash drums, three-phase separators, heat exchangers, reactors, distillation columns, extraction units and absorption columns.\n\nOpen only to students outside the Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science, Amrita University..

An environmental friendly building is always aesthetically pleasing and resource efficient.\nBut a lot of work goes into the construction of such massive structures. Given the alarming rise in environmental pollution, green buildings have become the need of the hour. Join for a 1-day workshop conducted by Robokart to learn about the sustainable design of green architecture.\n\nGreen building is the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building\u2019s life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and deconstruction. This practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility,\ndurability, and comfort. Globally, buildings are responsible for a huge share of energy, electricity, water and materials consumption. On the aesthetic side of green architecture or sustainable design is the philosophy of designing a building that is in harmony with the natural features and resources surrounding the site.\n\nTopics covered:\n1. Relationship between building sector and energy sector\n2.Approach to sustainable design\n3.Thermal performance of buildings\n4.Smart Materials for Buildings\n5.Renewable Energy Options for Buildings.

From perhaps the very beginning of history, we have looked up into the night skies, trying, and failing, to count the innumerable number of stars scattered across the dark night. But never was there reason for us to suspect that there was much, much more to the night sky than we\u2019d ever been able to witness, until the advent of astrophotography.\nIt has helped humankind to discover a number of new, unknown stars and nebulae, using long exposure photography to reveal what the naked human eye so far has not been able to visualise. These discoveries have enabled stunning realisations about the variegation of our universe. Want to be at the forefront of astrophotography, the driving force behind it all? Cosmic Light is a workshop on post-processing techniques for astrophotography. Learn about the presentation of the astro-photos that you capture, and also about several editing softwares specifically pertaining to astro-photography..
